\abstract{This document describes the \healpix Fortran90 subroutine WRITE\_FITS\_CUT4.}

\begin{facility}
{This routine writes a cut sky \healpix map into a FITS file. The format used for the
FITS file follows the one used for Boomerang98 and is adapted from COBE/DMR. 
This routine can be used to store polarized maps, where the
information relative to the Stokes parameters I, Q and U are placed in extension
0, 1 and 2 respectively by successive invocation of the routine.}
