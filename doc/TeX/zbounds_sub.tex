If zbounds(1)$<$zbounds(2), it is
performed {\em on} the strip zbounds(1)$<z<$zbounds(2); if not,
it is performed {\em outside} of the strip
%  zbounds(2)$<z<$zbounds(1). % OLD
zbounds(2)$\le z \le$zbounds(1). % NEW ??
% The whole sphere is treated if \texttt{zbounds=(/-1.0\_dp, 1.0\_dp/)} or if 
% it is absent.
If absent, the whole map is processed.
