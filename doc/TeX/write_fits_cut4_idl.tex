\abstract{This document describes the \healpix facility \facname.}




\begin{facility}
{This IDL facility writes out a cut sky \healpix map into a FITS file according to
the \healpix convention. The format used for the
FITS file follows the one used for Boomerang98 and is adapted from
COBE/DMR. This routine can be used to store polarized maps, where the
information relative to the Stokes parameters I, Q and U are placed in extension
0, 1 and 2 respectively by successive invocation of the routine.}

       \item[{COORDSYS=}] \mytarget{idl:write_fits_cut4:COORDSYS}
		  (optional), \\
		if set to either 'C', 'E' or 'G',  specifies that the
		Healpix coordinate system is respectively Celestial=equatorial,
		  Ecliptic or Galactic.
		(The relevant keyword is then added/updated in the extension
		  header, but the map is NOT rotated)

	\item[{EXTENSION=}] \mytarget{idl:write_fits_cut4:EXTENSION}
		  (optional), \\
	  (0 based) extension number in which to write data. \default{0}.
	  If set to 0 (or not set) {\em a new file is written from scratch}.
	  If set to a value
		  larger than 1, the corresponding extension is added or
		  updated, as long as all previous extensions already exist.
		  All extensions of the same file should use the same ORDERING,
		  NSIDE and COORDSYS.

    	\item[HDR=] \mytarget{idl:write_fits_cut4:HDR}%	
		(optional), \\
		String array containing the information to be put in

	scheme\\
	\seealso Ordering and Ring 

	\item[{NSIDE=}]  \mytarget{idl:write_fits_cut4:NSIDE}
		(optional), \\
		scalar integer, \healpix resolution parameter of the

		available to the FITS file, either thru this
		qualifier, or via the header (see XHDR).

	\item[{ORDERING=}] \mytarget{idl:write_fits_cut4:ORDERING}
		  (optional), \\
		if set to either 'ring' or 'nested' (case un-sensitive),
		  specifies that the map is respectively in RING or NESTED
		  ordering scheme\\
		\seealso Nested and Ring \\
	The ordering information should be made
		available to the FITS file, either thru a combination
		  of Ordering/Ring/Nested, or via the header (see XHDR).

	\item[{/POLARISATION}] \mytarget{idl:write_fits_cut4:POLARISATION}
	  specifies that file will contain the I, Q and U polarisation
           Stokes parameter in extensions 0, 1 and 2 respectively, and sets the
FITS header keywords accordingly

	\item[{/RING}]  \mytarget{idl:write_fits_cut4:RING} if set, specifies that the map is in the RING ordering
	scheme\\
	\seealso Ordering and Nested

	\item[{UNITS=}] \mytarget{idl:write_fits_cut4:UNITS}
		(optional), \\
		string describing the physical units of the data set (only applies
		to Signal and Serror)
