\abstract{This document describes the \healpix facility SYNFAST.}

\begin{facility}
{This program can be used to create  \healpix maps (temperature only
or temperature and polarisation)  computed as realisations 
of random Gaussian
fields on a sphere characterized by the user provided 
theoretical power spectra,
or as constrained realisations of such fields characterised by the user
provided $a_{\ell m}$ coefficients and/or power spectra.
Total operation count scales as
 ${\cal {O}}(\npix^{1/2}\lmax^2)$ where $\npix$ is the total number of pixels and 
$\lmax$ is the limiting spherical harmonics order. 
The map resolution, Gaussian beam FWHM,  
and random seed for the simulation can be selected by the user.
Spherical harmonics are either generated using the recurrence relations
during the execution of spectral synthesis, or  precomputed and read in
before the synthesis is executed. The latter is no longer recommended since
it provides no acceleration since the introduction of optimized algorithms
in \healpix v2.20. }

    \item[{infile = }]\mytarget{fac:synfast:infile}%
 Defines the input power spectrum file,

    \thedocid\ can run even if only {\tt almsfile} is provided.
    \item[{outfile = }]\mytarget{fac:synfast:outfile}%
 Defines the output (RING ordered) map file,

spatial derivatives (3 fields),
       4=temperature and its first and second spatial derivatives (6 fields), 5=temperature

the value $4\cdot$ {\tt nsmax}, because the coefficients of the  average Fourier 
pixel window functions
are precomputed and provided up to this limit.

 Defines the input filename for a file
    containing $a_{\ell m}$s for constrained realisations. 
(default= `'). If {\tt apply\_windows} is {\em false} 
those $a_{\ell m}$s are used as they are, without being multiplied
by the beam or pixel window function (with the assumption that they already have the
    correct window functions). If {\tt apply\_windows} is {\em true}, the beam and
    pixel window functions chosen above are applied to the constraining $a_{\ell m}$ (with the
    assumption that those are free of beam and pixel window function). The code
    does not check the validity of these asumptions; if none is true, use the
    \htmlref{alteralm}{fac:alteralm} facility to modify or remove
    the window functions contained in the constraining $a_{\ell m}$.
%
     \item[{apply\_windows = }]\mytarget{fac:synfast:apply_windows}%
  Determines how the constraining $a_{\ell m}$  read from
     {\tt almsfile} are
     treated with respect to window functions; see above for details. 
     y, yes, t, true, .true. and 1 are considered as {\em true}, while n, no, f,

\begin{codedescription}
{%
Synfast reads the power spectrum from a file in  ascii FITS
format. This can contain either just the temperature power spectrum $C^T_{\ell}$s or 
temperature and polarisation power spectra: $C^T_{\ell}$, $C^E_{\ell}$, $C^B_{\ell}$
and $C^{T\times E}_{\ell}$ (see \mylink{fac:synfast:note1}{Note 1, below}). If {\tt simul\_type = 2} \thedocid\ generates 
Q and U maps as well as the temperature map. The output map(s)
is (are) saved in a FITS file. 
The $C_{\ell}$s are used up to the specified 
$\lmax$, which can not exceed $4\times$ nsmax. If {\tt simul\_type = 3} or
{\tt 4} the first derivatives of the temperature field or the first and second derivatives respectively
are output as well as the temperature itself: $T(p)$, $\left({\partial T}/{\partial \theta}, {\partial T}/{\partial \phi}/\sin\theta \right)\myhtmlimage{}
$, $\left({\partial^2 T}/{\partial \theta^2}, {\partial^2 T}/{\partial
  \theta\partial\phi}/\sin\theta,\right.\myhtmlimage{}$ 
$\left.{\partial^2 T}/{\partial \phi^2}/\sin^2\theta \right)\myhtmlimage{}$.
If {\tt simul\_type = 5} or
{\tt 6} the first derivatives of the (T,Q,U) fields or the first and second derivatives respectively
are output as well as the field themself: $T(p)$,  $Q(p)$,  $U(p)$,
$\left({\partial T}/{\partial \theta}, {\partial Q}/{\partial \theta}, {\partial
  U}/{\partial \theta}; {\partial T}/{\partial \phi}/\sin\theta, \ldots \right)\myhtmlimage{}
$, $\left({\partial^2 T}/{\partial \theta^2},\ldots; {\partial^2 T}/{\partial
  \theta\partial\phi}/\sin\theta,\ldots ;\right.\myhtmlimage{}$ 
$\left.{\partial^2 T}/{\partial \phi^2}/\sin^2\theta \ldots \right)\myhtmlimage{}$

The random sequence seed for generation of $a_{\ell m}$ from the
power spectrum should be non-zero integer. If 0 is provided, a seed is generated
randomly by the code, based on the current date and time.
The map can be convolved with a gaussian beam for which a beamsize can
be specified, or for an arbitrary {\em circular} beam for which the
Legendre transform is provided. The map is automatically convolved with a pixel window
function. These are stored in FITS files  in
the {\tt healpix/data} directory. If \thedocid\ is not run in a directory
which has these files, or from a directory which can reach these files
by a `{\tt ../data/}' or `{\tt ./data/}' specification, the system
variable {\tt HEALPIX} is used to locate the main \healpix directory
and its {\tt data} subdirectory is scanned. Failing this, the location of these
files must be specified (using winfiledir). In the interactive mode this is
requested only when necessary (see 
\htmlref{Notes on default directories}{fac:subsec:defdir}
\latexhtml{ on page~\pageref{page:defdir}}{}).

If some of the $a_{\ell m}$ in the simulations are constrained eg. from observations, a FITS file
with these $a_{\ell m}$ can be read. This FITS file contains 
the $a_{\ell m}$ for certain $\ell$ and $m$ values
and also the standard deviation for these $a_{\ell m}$. The sky
realisation which \thedocid\ produces will be statistically consistent
with the constraining $a_{\ell m}$.

The code can also be used
to generate a set of $a_{\ell m}$ matching the input power spectra, beam size and
pixel size with or without actually synthesizing the map. Those $a_{\ell m}$ can be
used as an input (constraining $a_{\ell m}$) to another \thedocid\ run.

\begin{cd_contd}
{%
%---------------------------------
Spherical harmonics values in the synthesis are obtained from a
recurrence on associated Legendre polynomials $P_{\ell m}(\theta)$. 
This recurrence consumed most of the CPU time used by \thedocid\ up to version
2.15. We have therefore included an option to load precomputed values for the
$P_{\ell m}(\theta)$ from a file generated by the \healpix facility
\htmlref{plmgen}{fac:plmgen}. Since the introduction of accelerated spherical
harmonic transforms in \healpix v2.20, this feature is obsolete and should no
longer be used. 

\thedocid\ will issue a warning if the input FITS file for the power spectrum does
not contain the keyword {\tt POLNORM}. This keyword indicates that the convention
used for polarization is consistent with CMBFAST (and consistent with \healpix
1.2). See the 
\latexhtml{\htmladdnormallink{\healpix Primer}{intro.pdf}}{%
           \htmladdnormallink{\healpix Primer}{intro.htm}}
for details on the
polarization convention and the interface with CMBFAST. If the
keyword is not found, {\em no attempt will be made} to renormalize the power
spectrum. 
If the keyword is present, it will be inherited by the simulated map.

\mytarget{fac:synfast:note1}{\bf Note 1:} to allow the generation of maps (and $a_{\ell m}$) with $C^{T\times B}_{\ell} \ne 0$ and/or $C^{E\times B}_{\ell} \ne 0$,

{When 'filename' is present, \thedocid\ enters the non-interactive mode and parses
its inputs from the file 'filename'. This has the following
structure: the first entry is a qualifier which announces to the parser
which input immediately follows. If this input is omitted in the
input file, the parser assumes the default value.
If the equality sign is omitted, then the parser ignores the entry.
In this way comments may also be included in the file.
In this example, the file contains the following qualifiers:\hfill\newline
\fileparam{\mylink{fac:synfast:simul_type}{simul\_type}%

\fileparam{\mylink{fac:synfast:nsmax}{nsmax}%

 = 420.0}
\fileparam{\mylink{fac:synfast:infile}{infile}%
 = cl.fits}
\fileparam{\mylink{fac:synfast:outfile}{outfile}%
 = map.fits}

Synfast reads in the $C_{\ell}$ power spectrum in 'cl.fits' up to $\ell=64$, and
produces the (RING ordered) map
'map.fits' which has $\nside=32$.
The map is convolved with a beam of FWHM 420.0 arcminutes. The 
\mylink{fac:synfast:iseed}{iseed}$=-1$ sets
the random seed for the realisation. A different 
\mylink{fac:synfast:iseed}{iseed} would have given a different 
realisation from the same power spectrum.

This means that no file for constrained realisation or precomputed
Legendre polynomials are read, the $a_{\ell m}$ generated in the process are not
output, and \thedocid\ attempts to find the pixel
window files in the default directories (see
