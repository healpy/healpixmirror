\abstract{This document describes the \healpix facility ANAFAST.}

\begin{facility}
{This program performs harmonic analysis of the \healpix maps 
up to a user
specified maximum spherical harmonic order $\ell_{max}$.
The integrals are computed on the whole sphere, unless the user 
chooses  a provided option 
to excise from the input map(s) a simple, constant latitude, symmetric cut, and/or
apply an arbitray cut read from an external file.
Scalar, or scalar and tensor, spherical harmonic coefficients are evaluated
from the map(s) if the input provides, respectively, only the temperature,
or temperature and polarisation maps.
The total operation count scales as 
${\cal {O}}(N_{\rm pix}^{3/2} )$ with a prefactor
depending on $\ell_{max}$. 

Anafast reads one (two) file(s) containing the map(s) and produces 
a file containing the temperature auto- (or cross-) power spectrum
$C^T_l$ and, if requested, 
also the polarisation power spectra $C^E_l$, $C^B_l$, $C^{T\times E}_l$,
$C^{T\times B}_l$ and $C^{E\times B}_l$.
The $a_{lm}$  coefficients computed during the execution also can be  
written to a (two) file(s) if requested. 

Anafast executes an approximate, discrete point-set quadrature on 
a sphere
sampled at the \healpix pixel centers.
Spherical harmonic transforms are computed 
using recurrence relations for Legendre polynomials on co-latitude, 
$\theta$, 
and  Fast Fourier Transforms on longitude, $\phi$. 

Anafast is provided with an option to use precomputed Legendre Polynomials 
to decrease the total execution time.

Anafast permits two execution options 
which allow a significant improvement of accuracy of 
the approximate quadrature performed by this facility:

$\bullet$ An improved analysis using the provided ring weights, 
which correct the quadrature
on latitude, and/or
 
$\bullet$ An iterative scheme using in 
succession several backward and forward harmonic transforms 
of the maps.}

\begin{recommend}
{
Execution of \thedocid\ requires a user to specify the maximum 
spherical harmonic order $\ell_{max}$ up to which the harmonic 
decomposition of the input maps will be performed.
Since there are no formal limits on parameter
$\ell_{max}$ enforced by \thedocid, the user should make his/her choices
judiciously. 
Hereafter it is convenient to specify $\ell_{max}$  
in terms of the \healpix
map resolution parameter $nsmax$.

If the function to be analysed is strictly  band-width
limited, or nearly band-width limited (as in the case of 
a Gaussian beam smoothed signal discretized at a rate of a few pixels
per beam area), it is  sufficient to run \thedocid\ with
$\ell_{max} \approx 2\cdot nsmax$, with a very good $C_\ell$ 
error performance 
already in the raw (i.e. uncorrected quadrature) harmonic transform mode. 
If quadrature 
corrections are still desired in this case, it should be sufficient to use, at no
extra cost in execution time, the ring-weighted quadrature scheme. 
This is the recommended mode of operation of \thedocid\ for essentially
error and worry free typical applications, e.g. CPU-intensive 
Monte Carlo studies. 

If more aggressive attempts are undertaken to extract from a map 
the spectral coefficients at $\ell > 2\cdot nsmax$ (for example, as 
in a possible case of an attempt to analyse an existing map, which was 
irreversibly binned  at a suboptimal resolution) 
the following should be kept in mind:

$\bullet$ Spherical harmonics discretized using \healpix 
(either sampled at
pixel centers, or avaraged over pixel areas) form a linearly independent
system up to $\ell_{max} = 3 \cdot nsmax -1$. Hence, the functions which are
strictly band-width limited to $\ell_{max} = 3 \cdot nsmax - 1 $ 
can be fully
spectrally resolved with \thedocid, albeit with integration errors
in the uncorrected quadrature mode, which grow up to 
$\myhtmlimage{}\delta C_\ell \propto \epsilon \cdot C_\ell$, with $\epsilon <0.1$, 
at the highest values of $\ell$. These integration  errors 
can be efficiently 
reduced
using \thedocid\ in the iterative mode. Although this $\ell_{max}$ range
--- $2 \cdot nsmax < \ell_{max} < 3 \cdot nsmax - 1$ --- is easily
manageable with \thedocid\ used on strictly band-width limited functions,
it should be used with caution in basic and automated applications, e.g.
Monte Carlo simulations.

$\bullet$ As with any discrete Fourier transform, \thedocid\ application to
functions which are not band-width limited results with aliasing
of power, which can not be remedied. If the particular case of interest
may result in such a band-width violation (i.e. there is significant power
in the function at $\ell > 3 \cdot nsmax -1$), the function should
be smoothed before the application of \thedocid, or discretized and
then analysed, on a refined \healpix grid (with larger $nsmax$).

$\bullet$ REMEMBER: 
A peculiar property of the sphere, which usually surprizes those 
whose intuition is built on experience with FFTs on a segment, or 
on a Euclidean multidimensional domains, is the lack of 
a regular and uniform point-set at arbitrary resolution, 
and the resulting non-commutativity of the forward and
backward discrete Fourier transforms on nearly-uniform point-sets,
e.g. {\healpix}. Hence,
as in any case of attempting an extreme application of an off-the-shelf
software, use caution and understand your problem well {\it before}
executing \thedocid\ under such cicumstances!

the WMAP Kp intensity mask to the data (see

 will be correctly accounted when performing the monopole and dipole regression.\\
{\em Note:} The mask's resolution ($nsmax$) and ordering can be different from the input map(s)
one's, and the mask will be pro/down-graded and reordered to match the map. On the

attempt of rotation of the mask will be made).

otherwise set it to 0 (or 2). (default= 0)
\item[{regression = }] {{Sets the degree of the regression made on the
input map before doing the power spectrum analysis. 
The regression is a minimal variance fit (assuming a uniform noise) 
made on valid (unflagged and unmasked) pixels, out of the symmetric cut (if
any). In case of cut sky analysis, such a regression reduces the monopole

\begin{codedescription}
{
Anafast reads one of two binary FITS-files containing a \healpix map. These
files can each contain
a temperature map or both temperature and polarisation (Q,U) maps. Anafast analyses
the map(s) and makes an output ascii-FITS file containing the angular auto or cross
power spectra $C^T_l$s
(and $C^E_l$, $C^B_l$, $C^{T\times E}_l$, $C^{T\times B}_l$ and $C^{E\times B}_l$ if specified). Anafast
produces $C_l$s up to a specified maximum $\ell$-value
(see Recommendations for Users). Note in particular that if 2 maps are provided,
the $C^{T\times E}_l$ power
      spectrum will be build from the $T$ field of the 1st (polarized) map, and the $E$
      field of the second polarized map.
If requested, the computed $a_{lm}$ coefficients 
can  be written to a FITS file. This file can be used in the 
constrained realisation mode  of  \htmlref{synfast}{fac:synfast}. 

Anafast permits two execution modes that allow to improve 
the quadrature accuracy: 
(1) the  ring weight corrected quadrature, and
(2)  the  iterative scheme. 
Using the ring weights does not increase the execution time.  
The precomputed ring weights to be used for each 
\healpix resolution $nsmax$ are provided in
the {\tt \$HEALPIX/data} directory. 
The more sophisticated iterative scheme increases the
accuracy more effectively than the weighted ring scheme,
but its disadvantage is that the time for the analysis
increases, 1 iteration takes 3 times as long, 2 iterations 5 times as
long on so forth, since each order of iteration requires one more forward
and backward transform. 

The spherical harmonics evaluation uses  a
recurrence on associated Legendre polynomials $P_{lm}(\theta)$. 
This recurrence consumes most of the CPU time used by \thedocid. 
We have therefore included an option to load precomputed values for the
$P_{lm}(\theta)$ from a file generated by the \healpix facility
\htmlref{plmgen}{fac:plmgen}. This represents a tradeoff between memory usage and execution 
speed of \thedocid.

{When 'filename' is present, \thedocid\ enters the non-interactive mode and parses
its inputs from the file 'filename'. This has the following
structure: the first entry is a qualifier which announces to the parser
which input immediately follows. If this input is omitted in the
input file, the parser assumes the default value.
If the equality sign is omitted, then the parser ignores the entry.
In this way comments may also be included in the file.
In this example, the file contains the following qualifiers:\hfill\newline
\fileparam{simul\_type = 1}
\fileparam{nlmax = 64}
\fileparam{theta\_cut\_deg = 0}
\fileparam{iter\_order = 0}
\fileparam{infile = map.fits}
\fileparam{outfile = cl\_out.fits}
\fileparam{regression = 0}
Anafast reads the map from {\em map.fits}, makes an analysis and produces $C^T_l$s up to l=64.
This powerspectrum is saved in the file {\em cl\_out.fits}. 
No galactic cut is excised and no iterations are performed.
As regression is set to 0 (its default value) the map is analyzed as
is, without prior best fit removal of the monopole nor the dipole.

\fileparam{w8filedir}

were omitted, they take their default values (empty strings). 
This means that no file for precomputed
Legendre polynomials is read, no second map is read, no mask is applied, and \thedocid\ does not save the $a_{lm}$ values
from the analysis.

Also since\hfill\newline
\fileparam{won}
is not given, it takes it default value 2, which means that ring
weights are not used.
