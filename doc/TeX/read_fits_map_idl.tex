\begin{qualifiers}
  \begin{qulist}{} %%%% NOTE the ``extra'' brace here %%%%
 	\item[{File}] 
          name of a FITS file containing 
               the \healpix map in an extension or in the image field 

 	\item[{T\_sky}] 
	variable containing on output the \healpix map

       \item[{Hdr}]
		  (optional), \\
		string variable containing on output
		  the FITS primary header

       \item[{Exthdr}]
		  (optional), \\
		string variable containing on output
		  the FITS extension header

  	\item[{PIXEL=}] 
		(optional), \\
               pixel number to read from or pixel range to read
                 (in the order of appearance in the file), starting from 0. \\
               if $\ge$ 0 scalar        : read from pixel to the end of the file \\
               if two elements array : reads from pixel[0] to pixel[1]
		(included) \\
               if absent             : read the whole file

	 \item[{NSIDE=}]
		(optional), \\
	        returns on output the \healpix resolution parameter, as read
		from the FITS header. Set to -1 if not found

	 \item[{ORDERING=}]
	        (optional), \\
	        returns on output the pixel ordering, as read from the FITS
	        header. Either 'RING' or 'NESTED' or ' ' (if not found).

	 \item[{COORDSYS=}]
	        (optional), \\
	        returns on output the astrophysical coordinate system used, 
		as read from FITS header (value of keywords COORDSYS or SKYCOORD)

 

% 		Either row number in the binary table to read data from,
% 		  starting from row one, or a two element array containing a
% 		  range of row numbers to read.  If not passed, then the entire
% 		  file is read in.

\begin{codedescription}
{\thedocid\ reads in a \healpix sky map from a FITS file, and outputs
the variable {\tt T\_sky}, where the optional variables {\tt Hdr} 
and {\tt Exthdr} contain
respectively the primary and extension headers. According to \healpix
convention, the map should be is stored as a FITS file binary table
extension. Note:the routine \htmlref{read\_tqu}{idl:read_tqu} which requires less
memory is recommended when reading {\em large polarized} maps.}

  \begin{sulist}{} %%%% NOTE the ``extra'' brace here %%%%
  \item[idl] version \idlversion or more is necessary to run \thedocid
\input{item_read_fits_idl}
    \item[sxpar] This IDL routine (included in \healpix package) can be
  used to extract FITS keywords from the header(s) Hdr or Xhdr read with \thedocid.
  \item[synfast] This \healpix facility will generate the FITS format 
            sky map that can be read by \thedocid.
  \item[\htmlref{write\_fits\_map}{idl:write_fits_map}] This \healpix IDL facility can be used to generate the FITS format 
            sky maps complient with \healpix convention and readable by \thedocid.

{
\begin{tabular}{l} %%%% use this tabular format %%%%
\thedocid, 'planck100GHZ-LFI.fits', map, hdr, xhdr, /silent \\
\end{tabular}
}
{\thedocid\ reads in the file 'planck100GHZ-LFI.fits' and outputs the
\healpix map in {\tt map}, the primary header in {\tt hdr} and the extension
header in {\tt xhdr}.
