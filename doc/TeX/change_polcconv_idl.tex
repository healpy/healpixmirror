\abstract{This document describes the \healpix facility \facname.}

\begin{facility}
{This IDL facility  changes the coordinate convention in FITS file containing a polarised sky map.
The main effect is to change the sign of the U Stokes parameter,
and add/update the POLCCONV FITS header with either
COSMO or IAU value.}

        \item[{/I2C}]  \mytarget{idl:change_polcconv:I2C} changes from IAU to COSMO coordinate convention \\
            -if POLCCONV is not found or found with value 'IAU', it is

              The sign of U is swapped (if used with /C2I or /I2C), and the
              FITS keyword is updated accordingly.

\begin{codedescription}
{This routine will change the sign of the $U$ Stokes parameters (and related
quantities, such as the $TU$ and $QU$ cross-correlations) and update the
'POLCCONV' FITS keyword where applicable.
The recognised format are: \\
- standard Healpix  full sky polarised format \\
- cut sky Healpix polarised format \\
- WMAP 2nd year polarised format}
