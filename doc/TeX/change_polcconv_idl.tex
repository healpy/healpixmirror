\abstract{This document describes the \healpix facility \facname.}

\begin{facility}
{This IDL facility  changes the coordinate convention in FITS file containing a polarised sky map.
The main effect is to change the sign of the U Stokes parameter,
and add/update the POLCCONV FITS header with either
COSMO or IAU value.}

\begin{qualifiers}
  \begin{qulist}{} %%%% NOTE the ``extra'' brace here %%%%
 	\item[{File\_In}] 
          name of a FITS file to be read

 	\item[{File\_Out}] 
          name of a FITS file to be written, after modification of the
          polarisation coordinate convention, if applicable

  \begin{kwlist}{} %%% extra brace
        \item[{/I2C}] changes from IAU to COSMO coordinate convention \\
            -if POLCCONV is not found or found with value 'IAU', it is
             added/replaced with value 'COSMO', and the sign of the U stokes
             parameter map is changed \\
            -if POLCCONV already has value 'COSMO', File\_In is copied
            unchanged into File\_Out

        \item[{/C2I}] changes from COSMO to IAU coordinate convention \\
            -if POLCCONV is not found or found with value 'COSMO', it is
             added/replaced with value 'IAU', and the sign of the U stokes
             parameter map is changed \\
            -if POLCCONV already has value 'IAU',  File\_In is copied
            unchanged into File\_Out

        \item[{/C2C}] does NOT change coordinate system \\
            -if POLCCONV is found with value 'IAU', program will issue error
            message and no file is written \\
            -in all other case POLCCONV is set/added with value 'COSMO', but
             data is NOT changed

        \item[{/I2I}] does NOT change coordinate system \\
            -if POLCCONV is found with value 'COSMO', program will issue error
            message and no file is written \\
            -in all other case POLCCONV is set/added with value 'IAU', but
             data is NOT changed

        \item[{/FORCE}] if set, the value of POLCCONV read from the FITS header is
          ignored.
              The sign of U is swapped (if used with /C2I or /I2C), and the
              FITS keyword is updated accordingly.

\begin{codedescription}
{This routine will change the sign of the $U$ Stokes parameters (and related
quantities, such as the $TU$ and $QU$ cross-correlations) and update the
'POLCCONV' FITS keyword where applicable.
The recognised format are: \\
- standard Healpix  full sky polarised format \\
- cut sky Healpix polarised format \\
- WMAP 2nd year polarised format}
