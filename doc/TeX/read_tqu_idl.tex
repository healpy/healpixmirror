\abstract{This document describes the \healpix facility \thedocid.}

\begin{facility}
{This IDL facility reads a temperature+polarization Healpix map
(T,Q,U) from a binary table FITS file, 
with optionally the error (dT,dQ,dU) and correlation (dQU, dTU, dTQ)
from separate extensions

\begin{qualifiers}
  \begin{qulist}{} %%%% NOTE the ``extra'' brace here %%%%
 	\item[{File}] 
          name of a FITS file from which the maps are to be read

   \item[{TQU}] : array of Healpix maps of size ($N_{\rm pix}$,3,{\tt n\_ext}) where $N_{\rm pix}$ is the total
   number of Healpix pixels on the sky, and {\tt n\_ext} $\le$ 3 is
   the number of extensions read\\
     Three maps are available in each extension of the FITS file : \\
      -the temperature+polarization Stokes parameters maps (T,Q,U) in
   extension 0 \\
      -the error maps (dT,dQ,dU) in extension 1 (if applicable)\\
      -the correlation maps (dQU, dTU, dTQ) in extension 2 (if applicable)

       \item[{Extension=}]
		(optional), \\
	extension unit from which to read the data (0 based). 
	If absent, all available extensions are read

       \item[{Hdr=}]
		  (optional), \\
		string variable containing on output  the contents of the primary header. (If already present, FITS reserved
		  keywords will be automatically updated).

       \item[{Xhdr=}]
		  (optional), \\
		string variable containing on output the contents of the
		  extension header. If 
                  several extensions are read, then the extension 
                  headers are returned appended into one string array.

	 \item[{Nside=}]
		(optional), \\
	        returns on output the \healpix resolution parameter, as read
		from the FITS header. Set to -1 if not found

	 \item[{Ordering=}]
	        (optional), \\
	        returns on output the pixel ordering, as read from the FITS
	        header. Either 'RING' or 'NESTED' or ' ' (if not found).

	 \item[{Coordsys=}]
	        (optional), \\
	        returns on output the astrophysical coordinate system used, 
		as read from FITS header (value of keywords COORDSYS or SKYCOORD)

\begin{codedescription}
{\thedocid { }reads out Stokes parameters (T,Q,U) maps for the whole
sky into a FITS file. It is also possible to read the error per pixel for each
map and the correlation between fields, as subsequent extensions of the same FITS
file (see qualifiers above). Therefore the file may have up to three extensions with three
maps in each. Extensions can be written together or one by one (in
their physical order) using the Extension option}
