test data for Healpix 2.1

used by 'make test'

*.par: input parameter file of each code

*.fits: input data and reference for comparison of output

   --  cl.fits: input power spectrum of current release.
       currently identical to wmap_lcdm_pl_model_yr1_v1.fits (see Note below)
   --  cl_old.fits: input power spectrum of previous Healpix releases

see Installation Document for details


Notes: 
     1) The file wmap_lcdm_pl_model_yr1_v1.fits currently matches cl.fits
  which was used for test simulations present in this directory.

  It is WMAP 1yr best fit, Spergel et al, 2003; with B modes = 0
  assuming a power low spectrum. It is identical to
  http://lambda.gsfc.nasa.gov/data/map/powspec/wmap_lcdm_pl_model_yr1_v1.fits
  except for cosmetic editions of the FITS header

  It is defined up to l=3000.


     2) The file wmap_lcdm_sz_lens_wmap5_cl_v3.fits 
 has been added in this directory for convenience, even though
 it is currently *NOT* used in any of the simulations included here.

 It is adapted from WMAP 5yr best fit model for l-CDM + SZ + lensing with B mode = 0
 input file = wmap_lcdm_sz_lens_wmap5_cl_v3.dat;
 For the list of parameters, see 
 http://lambda.gsfc.nasa.gov/product/map/dr3/params/lcdm_sz_lens_wmap5.cfm

 It is defined up to l=2000.


     3) The file wmap_lcdm_sz_lens_wmap7_cl_v4.fits 
 has been added in this directory for convenience, even though
 it is currently *NOT* used in any of the simulations included here.

 It is adapted from WMAP 7yr best fit model for l-CDM + SZ + lensing with 
 lensed B mode > 0
 For the list of parameters, see 
 http://lambda.gsfc.nasa.gov/product/map/dr4/params/lcdm_sz_lens_wmap7.cfm
 It was produced with CAMB (Feb2009; recfast 1.4.2) run with l_max_scalar=4000, 
 which should improve the lensed BB spectrum compared to lower l runs.   

 It is defined up to l=3726.


     4) The file planck2013ext_lcdm_cl_v1.fits
 has been added in this directory for convenience, even though
 it is currently *NOT* used in any of the simulations included here.

 It is the theoretical Lambda-CDM best fit to
 Planck 2013 + WMAP9 Polarization (l<24) + ACT + SPT + SDSS DR7+WiggleZ+BOSS DR9+6dF
 with lensed B modes > 0

  for further details.                                                    

 It is defined up to l=4500.
