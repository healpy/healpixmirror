Notes: 
     1) The file wmap_lcdm_pl_model_yr1_v1.fits currently (aka cl.fits, aka cl_wmap1.fits)
  which was used for test simulations present in this directory.

  It is WMAP 1yr best fit, Spergel et al, 2003; with B modes = 0
  assuming a power low spectrum. It is identical to
  http://lambda.gsfc.nasa.gov/data/map/powspec/wmap_lcdm_pl_model_yr1_v1.fits
  except for cosmetic editions of the FITS header

  It is defined up to l=3000.


     2) The file wmap_lcdm_sz_lens_wmap5_cl_v3.fits (aka cl_wmap5.fits)
 has been added in this directory for convenience, even though
 it is currently *NOT* used in any of the simulations included here.

 It is adapted from WMAP 5yr best fit model for l-CDM + SZ + lensing with B mode = 0
 input file = wmap_lcdm_sz_lens_wmap5_cl_v3.dat;
 For the list of parameters, see 
 http://lambda.gsfc.nasa.gov/product/map/dr3/params/lcdm_sz_lens_wmap5.cfm

 It is defined up to l=2000.


     3) The file wmap_lcdm_sz_lens_wmap7_cl_v4.fits  (aka cl_wmap7.fits)
 has been added in this directory for convenience, even though
 it is currently *NOT* used in any of the simulations included here.

 It is adapted from WMAP 7yr best fit model for l-CDM + SZ + lensing with 
 lensed B mode > 0
 For the list of parameters, see 
 http://lambda.gsfc.nasa.gov/product/map/dr4/params/lcdm_sz_lens_wmap7.cfm
 It was produced with CAMB (Feb2009; recfast 1.4.2) run with l_max_scalar=4000, 
 which should improve the lensed BB spectrum compared to lower l runs.   

 It is defined up to l=3726.


     4) The file planck2013ext_lcdm_cl_v1.fits  (aka cl_planck1.fits)
 has been added in this directory for convenience, even though
 it is currently *NOT* used in any of the simulations included here.

 It is the theoretical Lambda-CDM best fit to
 Planck 2013 + WMAP9 Polarization (l<24) + ACT + SPT + SDSS DR7+WiggleZ+BOSS DR9+6dF
 with lensed B modes > 0

  for further details.                                                    

 It is defined up to l=4500.

     5) The file planck2015_lcdm_cl_v2.fits  (aka cl_planck2.fits)
 has been added in this directory for convenience, even though
 it is currently *NOT* used in any of the simulations included here.

 It is the theoretical Lambda-CDM best fit to
 Planck 2015 baseline analysis (plikTT + lowTEB)

 It is defined up to l=4900.



     6) The file planck2018_lcdm_cl_v3.fits  (aka cl_planck3.fits)
 has been added in this directory for convenience, even though
 it is currently *NOT* used in any of the simulations included here.

 It is the theoretical Lambda-CDM best fit to Planck 2018 baseline analysis

 Produced by CAMB (v0.1.6.1 = Aug17) with the cosmological parameters read from 
 http://pla.esac.esa.int/pla/aio/product-action?COSMOLOGY.FILE_ID=COM_PowerSpect_CMB-base-plikHM-TTTEEE-lowl-lowE-lensing-minimum_R3.01.txt

 C(l) values, especially (lensing) BB or CURL may differ from the ones in

  because higher accuracy settings were used for the present file.
