 This sub-directory contains IDL procedures from external libraries 
 which are required for use by the HEALPix IDL facilities.

 These procedures are included in the HEALPix package unchanged and 
 solely for the purpose of making it self contained. In this way,
 we remove the 'burden' of installation of additional libraries from 
 the end user.

 The respective copyrights, restrictions and disclaimers of the original 
 libraries apply for these procedures.

 o  ./astron/ : required routines from  THE IDL ASTRONOMY USER'S LIBRARY 
    (http://idlastro.gsfc.nasa.gov/homepage.html)
    including their supporting D. Fanning's COYOTE routines 
    (http://www.idlcoyote.com/documents/programs.php)

 o  ./cgis/ : required routines from the COBE cgis library
    (http://space.gsfc.nasa.gov/astro/cobe/cgis.html)

 o ./obsolete_astron/ : routines from the Astron library which are now considered
   obsolete, but may still be needed by Healpix (or by user-developped applications).
