-------------------------------------------------------------------------
Various test files and a Makefile to exercise them are in the source
repository, which is currently a subdirectory of the texlive Subversion
repo, purely for the developers' convenience:
  http://tug.org/svn/texlive/trunk/Build/extra/epstopdf/

The test-binary and test-bin2 files there were supplied by Akira Kakuto and
Reinhard Kotucha.  They contain binary data.  They are public domain.

The test-binhdr* files were supplied by Martin von Gagern, constructed
as follows.  They contain binary junk before the EPS starts.  We also
use these to test different line endings.  These files are public domain.
