REVISION HISTORY:
   Version 1.0 --- Initial release.

   Version 1.1 --- Added \circ, fixed vector \varphi.

   Version 1.2 --- Added \vartheta.

   Version 2.0 --- Renamed strtok to str_token to avoid name conflict 
		   in IDL 5.3. Still works in older version of IDL.

   Version 2.1 --- Replaced the obsolete function str_sep with the 
                   function strsplit. Will not work with versions of 
                   IDL prior to 5.3.

   Version 2.11 -- Bug fix of v2.1. Fixes error in transition to strsplit . 
   Version 2.12 -- Two changes:
		     - Bug fix: call of strtrans in textoidl.pro; special 
		       characters "^" and "_" need to be escaped.
		     - All arrays are now in square bracket notation.
