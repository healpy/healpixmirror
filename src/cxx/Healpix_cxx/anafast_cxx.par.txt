Parameters read by anafast_cxx:

nlmax (integer):
  maximum order of l

nmmax (integer):
  maximum order of m (must not be larger than nlmax, default=nlmax)

infile (string):
  input file containing the Healpix map

outfile (string, default=""):
  output file name for power spectrum; if empty, no spectrum is written

outfile_alms (string, default=""):
  output file name for the a_lm; if empty, no a_lm are written

polarisation (bool):
  if false, only the intensity a_lm are generated,
  if true, a_lm for T, G and C component are generated

ringweights (string, default=""):
  if supplied, ring weights will be read from this file
  NOTE: mutually exclusive with "pixelweights".

pixelweights (string, default=""):
  if supplied, compressed pixel weights will be read from this file
  NOTE: mutually exclusive with "ringweights".

iter_order (integer, default=0)
  number of iterations for the analysis (0: standard analysis)

double_precision (bool, default=false):
  if false, maps and a_lm are read/written in single precision,
  otherwise in double precision.

if (polarisation==true && outfile!="")
  full_powerspectrum (bool, default=false):
    if true, write a 6-column power spectrum;
    if false, write a 4-column power spectrum.
endif

remove_monopole (bool, default=false):
  if true, subtract the average pixel value from the temperature map, and add
  the corresponding value to almT(0,0) after the map2alm transform.
