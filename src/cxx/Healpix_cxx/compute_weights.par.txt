Parameters read by compute_weights:

nside (integer):
  Nside parameter for which weights should be computed

nlmax (integer):
  maximum order of l
  A good value is typically 3*nside. Using a slightly higher value may work,
  but it is possible that the minimization will not converge.
  NOTE: map analyses using the resulting pixel weights will be accurate if the
  input map is band-limited at nlmax/2!

epsilon (double, default=1e-7):
  termination criterion for the minimization iteration
  This value must lie between 0 and 1, and gives a rough estimate for the
  reduction of the errors when analyzing a map with the computed weights,
  compared to an analysis with uniform weights.

  Convergence will become slower for increasing Nside when keeping epsilon
  constant; for high Nside it may be necessary to increase epsilon to 1e-3
  or even higher.

  The output file will contain the last epsilon value reached during the
  iteration, which may be higher than the requested value if the maximum
  number of iterations was reached.

max_iter (integer, default=10000):
  maximum number of iterations for the iterative minimization
  if max_iter is reached, the current estimate for the weights will be written
  to the output file, even though the desired epsilon has not been reached.

outfile_ring (string, optional):
  if present, the Healpix ring weights will be computed and written to this
  file

outfile_full (string, optional):
  if present, the full pixel weights will be computed and written to this file
