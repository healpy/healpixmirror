Parameters read by needlet_tool:

mode (string):
  split   : a single a_lm file is input and split into needlet bands
  assemble: multiple needlet bands are read and combined into a single a_lm file

needlet_type (string):
  needatool: use needlets as defined by Pietrobon et al., ApJ 723, 1 (2010),
             following the construction in section 3
  basak    : use needlets as defined by Basak et al., MNRAS 419, 1163 (2012),
             following the equations in section 3
  sdw      : use needlets as defined by Leistedt et al., A&A 558, A128 (2013),
             following equations 10 to 15

if (needlet_type=="basak"):
  lpeak (string):
    comma-separated list of integer numbers containing the lpeak values for each
    band to be used.
    Each needlet has support from the preceding lpeak (or 0 in the case of the
    first needlet) to the next lpeak (or its own lpeak, for the last needlet).
else
  B (double):
    B parameter for the respective needlet
    The window for the nth band peaks at l=B^n.
endif

infile (string):
  if mode=="split"   : input file containing the a_lm
  if mode=="assemble": root name for the input a_lm files
                       Full names are "<infile>###.fits",
                       where ### is the three-digit number of the band

outfile (string):
  if mode=="split"   : root name for the output a_lm files
                       Full names are "<outfile>###.fits",
                       where ### is the three-digit number of the band
  if mode=="assemble": output file containing the assembled a_lm

polarisation (bool):
  if false, only the intensity a_lm are processed,
  if true, the code currently exits with an error message,
  since polarisation is not yet supported.

double_precision (bool, default=false):
  if false, a_lm are read/written in single precision,
  otherwise in double precision.



General remarks on the code
===========================

Splitting and reassembling a set of a_lm should accurately reproduce the input
a_lm at all l starting from the first peak (which is 1 for "needatool" and "sdw"
needlets, but may be different for "basak" wavelets).
The remaining information in the input data (monopole for "needatool" and "sdw",
everything below the first peak for "basak") is currently discarded, but could
also be written to an additional output file.
