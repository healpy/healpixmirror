  \param spin the spin of the quantities to be transformed
  \param alm contains pointers to the a_lm coefficients. If \a spin==0,

  \param alm_info A \c hpsharp_alm_info object compatible with the provided

  \param ntrans the number of simultaneous SHTs
  \param flags See hpsharp_jobflags. In particular, if SHARP_DP is set, then
    \a alm is expected to have the type "complex double **" and \a map is
    expected to have the type "double **"; otherwise, the expected
    types are "complex float **" and "float **", respectively.
